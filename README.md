# League of Legends API Project

Welcome to my LoL Project!

I have used Mobalytics and OP.GG in the past but find the applications clunky, slow, and difficult to deal with. I created this so that I can solve the issue and give my friends a helpful app that does not crash their league client or cause excessive lag in the process.

I am using the Riot API to make it easy to search a summoner name to find relevant info. I also would love to eventually have a comparison page, comparing two account stats, as well as a page that automatically loads in rank and champion-specific statistics when you load in a game.

If there is something you have always wanted to assist you in playing League, I would love ideas and feedback!
